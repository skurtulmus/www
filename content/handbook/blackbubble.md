I prefer using the Vim text editor with a fairly barebones setup for all of my coding needs.
I also use Vim for all document editing purposes, often coupled with groff or LaTeX for creating PDF files.
Since I like working with Vim so much, I decided to create a very simple Vim script called `blackbubble` for creating slides and presenting them from within Vim.
[This Github link](https://github.com/skurtulmus/blackbubble) contains the plugin files, installation instructions and a guide for basic usage.
